            <h3 class="font-weight-bold spanborder"><span>Ethics</span></h3>
            <p>
                The UMJM adheres to "Ethical Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research" set forth by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors where applicable:
            </p>
            <h4><span>Informed Consent</span></h4>
            <p>
                Patients have a right to privacy that should not be violated without informed consent. Identifying information, including names, initials, or hospital numbers, should not be published in written descriptions, photographs, or pedigrees unless the information is essential for scientific purposes and the patient (or parent or guardian) gives written informed consent for publication. Informed consent for this purpose requires that an identifiable patient be shown the manuscript to be published. Authors should disclose to these patients whether any potential identifiable material might be available via the Internet as well as in print after publication.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nonessential identifying details should be omitted. Informed consent should be obtained if there is any doubt that anonymity can be maintained. For example, masking the eye region in photographs of patients is inadequate protection of anonymity. If identifying characteristics are altered to protect anonymity, such as in genetic pedigrees, authors should provide assurance, and editors should so note, that such alterations do not distort scientific meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                When informed consent has been obtained, it should be indicated in the published article.
            </p>
            <h4><span>Conflict of Interest</span></h4>
            <p>
                When authors submit a manuscript, whether an article or a letter, they are responsible for disclosing all financial and personal relationships that might bias their work. To prevent ambiguity, authors must state explicitly whether potential conflicts do or do not exist. Authors should do so in the manuscript on a conflict-of-interest notification page that follows the title page, providing additional detail, if necessary, in a cover letter that accompanies the manuscript.
            </p>
            <p>
                Authors should identify individuals who provide writing or other assistance and disclose the funding source for this assistance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Investigators must disclose potential conflicts to study participants and should state in the manuscript whether they have done so.
            </p>
            <h4><span>Human and Animal Testing</span></h4>
            <p>
                When reporting experiments on human subjects, authors should indicate whether the procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. If doubt exists whether the research was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, the authors must explain the rationale for their approach and demonstrate that the institutional review body explicitly approved the doubtful aspects of the study. When reporting experiments on animals, authors should indicate whether the institutional and national guide for the care and use of laboratory animals was followed.
            </p>
            <a class="anchor" id="peer-review-process"></a>
            <h3 class="font-weight-bold spanborder"><span>Peer Review Process</span></h3>
            <p>
                All submission outlines and manuscripts are subject to multiple rounds of blinded review conducted in duplicate. Both reviewers and authors are anonymized. Submission outlines, manuscripts first drafts, and manuscript third drafts are reviewed in duplicate by a senior and junior student editor. Different student editors will be assigned to a given manuscript at each stage of review (outline, first draft, third draft). Manuscript second drafts are reviewed by a faculty editor.
            </p>
